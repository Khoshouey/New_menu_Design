Using transparency option in Visual Studio Forms to make new Modern Designs  
The main idea of the transparency forms appears in 90's I use it in some desktop games and some funny birthday animation cards for my family and my friend's kids.

In this year I started publishing in Udemy some programming languages courses and thought to add some funny to the training materials. So, I start a course teaching parents how to create Cartoon story in 10 minutes for their kids and the other one is how to design modern proficient forms for Visual studio without using the complicated Paint shop Pro or Photoshop just 

using PowerPoint and Microsoft Paint. I tested the idea with some Mechanical engineers need to design a Gas Compressor Calculator parameters with charts. The modern design was simple put amazing because it is contains the image of Gas Compressor in the background with opacity 0.5 and all other controls of the form have opacity 1. I hope you enjoy the simple idea of this design. And use it in great applications and software.
